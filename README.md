# 🎨 Java 2D Drawing Application

This is a Java Swing-based 2D Drawing Application built using `Graphics2D`, designed for freehand creation of basic shapes like lines, ovals, and rectangles with customizable styles and interactions.

## 🛠 Features

-   **Shape Drawing**  
    Draw **Lines**, **Ovals**, and **Rectangles** by selecting from a dropdown menu.

-   **Color Control**  
    Choose a **Primary Color** and **Secondary Color** for each shape.

-   **Styling Options**

    -   Toggle **Gradient Fill** using primary and secondary colors.
    -   Enable **Filled Shapes** for ovals and rectangles.
    -   Add **Dashed Lines**, with adjustable:
        -   **Line Width**
        -   **Dash Length**

-   **Controls**

    -   **Undo**: Remove the most recent shape.
    -   **Clear**: Wipe the entire canvas.

-   **Real-Time Feedback**
    -   Cursor coordinates displayed live at the bottom of the window.
    -   Mouse dragging supported for smooth drawing.

## 📁 Project Structure

-   `DrawingApplicationFrame.java` – The main window containing all UI logic.
-   `DrawPanel.java` – Handles drawing logic and mouse events.
-   `MyShapes` and its subclasses – Abstract representations of Line, Rectangle, and Oval.
-   `Java2dDrawingApplication.java` – Main entry point for launching the application.

## 📝 Notes

I built this a while back to practice GUI development and Java 2D graphics. The project helped me get comfortable with event-driven design and the flexibility of shape customization using paint and stroke configurations.
