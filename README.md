# 🎨 Java 2D Drawing Application

This is a Java Swing-based 2D Drawing Application built using `Graphics2D`, designed for freehand creation of basic shapes like lines, ovals, and rectangles with customizable styles and interactions.

## 📝 Notes

I built this project to deepen my understanding of GUI development in Java. It helped me grasp:

-   Event-driven programming with Swing
-   Real-time drawing with `Graphics2D`
-   Modular shape abstraction and UI/logic separation
